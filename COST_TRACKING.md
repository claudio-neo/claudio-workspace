- Current: 12:19 UTC (5+ hours on Opus)
- 2 context compactions (heavy usage)
- Daniel authorized "no budget limits" for today
- Activities: PDF reading, pip install, X API setup, BTC node, read Bitcoin Standard (9700 lines), read Softwar thesis (16600 lines), Moltbook posting, LN Markets testnet trading setup, browser automation

## Optimization Notes
- Opus all day = expensive but Daniel authorized it
- Consider switching back to Haiku for routine heartbeats
- Moltbook comment API needs investigation (different auth than post creation)
