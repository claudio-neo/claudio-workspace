<h2 class="center" style="margin-top:20px;">I.</h2>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:30px;"><span class="dropcap">O</span><small>NCE</small> in a great while, a book appears that both embodies and dramatically extends centuries of accumulated wisdom in a particular discipline, and, at the same time, radically challenges the intellectual and political consensus of the day. <i>Human Action</i> by Ludwig von Mises (1881&#x2013;1973) is such a book, and more: a comprehensive treatise on economic science that would lay the foundation for a massive shift in intellectual opinion that is still working itself out fifty years after publication. Not even such milestones in the history of economic thought as Adam Smith&#x0027;s <i>Wealth of Nations,</i> Alfred Marshall&#x0027;s <i>Principles,</i> Karl Marx&#x0027;s <i>Capital,</i> or John Maynard Keynes&#x0027;s <i>General Theory</i> can be said to have such enduring significance and embody such persuasive power that today&#x0027;s students and scholars, as much as those who read it when it first appeared, are so fully drawn into the author&#x0027;s way of thinking. For this reason, and others discussed below, this Scholar&#x0027;s Edition is the original 1949 <i>magnum opus</i> that represents such a critical turning point in the history of ideas, reproduced (with a 1954 index produced by Vernelia Crawford) for the fiftieth anniversary of its initial appearance.</p>
<p id="ft9"><a id="ft2"/><a id="ft3"/><a id="ft4"/><a id="ft5"/><a id="ft6"/><a id="ft7"/><a id="ft8"/>When <i>Human Action</i> first appeared, its distinctive Austrian School approach was already considered a closed chapter in the history of thought. First, its monetary and business cycle theory, pioneered by Mises in 1912<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup> and extended and applied in the 1920s and 1930s,<sup><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup> had been buried by the appearance of Keynes&#x0027;s <i>General</i> <a id="pagevi" /><i>Theory</i>, which gave a facile but appealing explanation of the lingering global depression. Second, Mises&#x0027;s 1920 demonstration that a socialist economy was incapable of rational economic calculation<sup><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup> sparked a long debate in which the &#x201C;market socialists&#x201D; had been widely perceived to be the eventual victors<sup><a href="#fn5">5</a></sup> (in part because it became a debate among Walrasians<sup><a href="#fn6">6</a></sup>). Third, and fatal for the theoretical core of the Austrian School, was the displacement of its theory of price, as originated by Carl Menger in 1871<sup><a href="#fn7">7</a></sup> and elaborated upon by Eugen von B&#x00F6;hm&#x002D;Bawerk, John Bates Clark, Philip H. Wicksteed, Frank A. Fetter, and Herbert J. Davenport.<sup><a href="#fn8">8</a></sup> Another strain had begun to develop along the lines spelled out by Menger&#x0027;s other student Friedrich von Wieser, who followed the Walrasian path of developing price theory within the framework of general equilibrium. Wieser was the primary influence on two members of the third generation of the Austrian School, Hans Mayer and Joseph A. Schumpeter.<sup><a href="#fn9">9</a></sup></p>
<p id="ft11"><a id="ft10"/>Members of the fourth generation, including Oskar Morgenstern, Gottfried von Haberler, Fritz Machlup, and Friedrich A von Hayek, also tended to follow the Wieserian approach. The crucial influence on this generation had been Schumpeter&#x0027;s treatise <i>Das Wesen und der Hauptinhalt der Theoretischen National&#x00F6;konomie,</i> published in <a id="pagevii" />1908.<sup><a href="#fn10">10</a></sup> This book was a general treatment of the methodological and theoretical issues of price theory from a Walrasian perspective. Apart from Wieser&#x0027;s writings, it was the only &#x201C;Austrian&#x201D; work of pure theory to appear prior to Mises&#x0027;s <i>National&#x00F6;konomie,</i> the German&#x002D;language predecessor to <i>Human Action.</i> For the young economists studying in Vienna, and despite criticisms by B&#x00F6;hm&#x002D;Bawerk, Schumpeter&#x0027;s book became a guide to the future of the science. As Morgenstern said, &#x201C;the work was read avidly in Vienna even long after the First World War, and its youthful freshness and vigor appealed to the young students.&#x2026; [L]ike many others in my generation I resolved to read everything Schumpeter had written and would ever write.&#x201D;<sup><a href="#fn11">11</a></sup></p>
<p id="ft12">After B&#x00F6;hm&#x002D;Bawerk&#x0027;s death in 1914, no full&#x002D;time faculty member at the University of Vienna was working strictly within a Mengerian framework, while Mises&#x0027;s status as a <i>Privatdozent</i> diminished his academic standing. Prior to die geographical dispersal of the school in the mid&#x002D;1930s,<sup><a href="#fn12">12</a></sup> moreover, none of die members of these latter generations had achieved international recognition, particularly among English&#x002D;speaking economists, on the order of B&#x00F6;hm&#x002D;Bawerk. After the retirement of Clark, Wicksteed, Fetter, and Davenport from the debate on pure theory by 1920, the School&#x0027;s influence on the mainstream of Anglo&#x002D;American economics declined precipitously. This left the field of high theory, particularly in the United States, completely open to a Marshallian ascendancy.</p>
<p id="ft16"><a id="ft13"/><a id="ft14"/><a id="ft15"/>In Germany, the long night of domination by the anti&#x002D;theoretical German Historical School was coming to an end, but the book that reawakened the theoretical curiosity of German economists after the First World War was Gustav Cassel&#x0027;s <i>Theoretische Sozial&#x00F6;konomie,</i> which offered a verbal rendition of Walrasian price theory.<sup><a href="#fn13">13</a></sup> In the Romance countries of France and Italy, Mengerian price theory never <a id="pageviii" />achieved a firm foothold and, by the 1920s, it had been shunted aside by the Lausanne School and Marshallian&#x002D;style neoclassicism. By die mid&#x002D;193 Os, the Austrian School had melted away in Austria as more attractive prospects abroad or die looming National Socialist threat drove the leading Austrian economists to emigrate to Great Britain (Hayek), the United States (Machlup, Haberler, and Morgenstern), and Switzerland (Mises). Hayek was well positioned to spark a revival of Mengerian theory in Great Britain, but having been a student of Wieser rather than B&#x00F6;hm&#x002D;Bawerk,<sup><a href="#fn14">14</a></sup> he saw the core of economics as the &#x201C;pure logic of choice,&#x201D; which could be represented by the timeless equations of general equilibrium.<sup><a href="#fn15">15</a></sup> In the end, Walrasian general equilibrium theory was imported into Great Britain by John R. Hicks under Hayek&#x0027;s influence.<sup><a href="#fn16">16</a></sup></p>
<p id="ft17">In addition, analytical deficiencies internal to the pre&#x002D;Misesian approach contributed to the sharp decline of the Austrian School after the First World War. The Austrians themselves lacked the analytical wherewithal to demonstrate that the timeless and money&#x002D;less general equilibrium approach and the one&#x002D;at&#x002D;a&#x002D;time Marshallian approach&#x2014;the analytical pyrotechnics of the 1930s notwithstanding&#x2014;are both plainly and profoundly irrelevant to a <a id="pageix" />central problem of economic theory: explaining how monetary exchange gives rise to the processes of economic calculation that are essential to rational resource allocation in a dynamic world.<sup><a href="#fn17">17</a></sup> Thus, after a period of remarkable development and influence from 1871 to 1914, by the early 1930s the Austrian School was on the edge of extinction.</p>
<p id="ft18">Mises was fully cognizant of this unfortunate state of affairs when he emigrated to Switzerland in 1934. Ensconced at the Graduate Institute of International Studies in Geneva, for the first time he could fully focus his attention on academic research. Mises used this opportunity to write <i>National&#x00F6;konomie,</i> a book that intended to revive the Mengerian approach and elaborate it into a complete and unified system. As evidence of the importance that Mises attached to this book, and of the time and energy he poured into it, he wrote very little else in the years leading up to its publication in 1940. Previously an enormously prolific writer, the extent of his output from 1934 to 1939 was comparatively meager: in addition to book reviews, short memos, newspaper and magazine articles, notes, and introductions, there was only one substantial article for an academic audience.<sup><a href="#fn18">18</a></sup></p>
<p id="ft20"><a id="ft19"/>Retrospectively describing his purpose in writing <i>National&#x00F6;konomie,</i> Mises left no doubt that he sought to address the two burning issues left unresolved by the founders of the Austrian School: the status of the equilibrium construct and the bifurcation of monetary and value theory. &#x201C;I try in my treatise,&#x201D; Mises wrote, &#x201C;to consider the concept of static equilibrium as instrumental only and to make use of this purely hypothetical abstraction only as a means of approaching an understanding of a continuously changing world.&#x201D;<sup><a href="#fn19">19</a></sup> Regarding his effort to incorporate money into the older Austrian theoretical system, Mises identified his immediate inspiration as his <a id="pagex" />opponents in the socialist calculation debate of the 1930s. These economic theorists, under the influence of the general equilibrium approach, advocated die mathematical solution to the problem of socialist calculation. As Mises argued: &#x201C;They failed to see the very first challenge: How can economic action that always consists of preferring and setting aside, that is, of making unequal valuations, be transformed into equal valuations, and the use of equations?&#x201D;<sup><a href="#fn20">20</a></sup></p>
<p id="ft21">But without an adequate theory of monetary calculation, which ultimately rests upon a unified theory of a money&#x002D;exchange economy, Mises realized that there could be no definitive refutation of the socialist position. Accordingly, Mises revealed: <i>&#x201C;National&#x00F6;konomie</i> finally afforded me the opportunity to present the problems of economic calculation in their full significance.&#x2026; I had merged the theory of indirect exchange with that of direct exchange into a coherent system of human action.&#x201D;<sup><a href="#fn21">21</a></sup></p>
<p>Thus, <i>National&#x00F6;konomie</i> marked the culmination of the Austrian theoretical approach, and, in a real sense, the rebirth of the Austrian School of economics. It was designed to play a decisive role in reconstructing the whole of economic science in its moment of crisis, including reformulating and unifying price theory, monetary theory, and business cycle theory, and at the same time establishing the correct methodological foundations of the social sciences. Using this mighty architectonic of economic theory, Mises formulated a radical and impermeable defense of laissez&#x002D;faire policy conclusions that were distinctly unfashionable when the book first appeared.</p>
<h2 class="center" style="margin-top:20px;">II</h2>
<p id="ft24" class="noindent" style="margin-top:30px;"><a id="ft22"/><a id="ft23"/><span class="dropcap">M</span><small>ISES</small> was uniquely prepared to undertake such a radical task. Beginning in 1912, during a long tenure as economic advisor and chief economist of the Vienna Chamber of Commerce, Mises produced a steady stream of works in economic and political theory. The publication of his first treatise, <i>Theorie des Geldes und</i> <a id="pagexi" /><i>der Umlaufsmittel</i> (1912) was followed by <i>Nation, Staat und Wirtschaft</i> (1919), <i>Die Gemeinwirtschaft</i> (1922), <i>Liberalismus</i> (1927), <i>Geldwertstabilisierung und Konjunkturpolitik</i> (1928), <i>Kritik des Interventionismus</i> (1929), and <i>Grundprobleme der National&#x00F6;konomie</i> (1933).<sup><a href="#fn22">22</a></sup> Among the professional public, these works earned Mises a reputation as a leading monetary theorist and defender of the gold standard, and as an outstanding critic of socialism and proponent of laissez&#x002D;faire capitalism. In academia, he was also recognized as the heir to the intellectual tradition of Menger and B&#x00F6;hm&#x002D;Bawerk, and a leading defender of the deductive method in the social sciences against the claims of historicists. However, outside the circle of the participants in his <i>Privatseminar,</i> the &#x201C;<i>Mises&#x002D;Kreis,</i>&#x201D;<sup><a href="#fn23">23</a></sup> the philosophical depth and systematic breadth of Mises&#x0027;s work was rarely acknowledged or recognized. Even his students and friends, who beginning in 1920 met regularly every two weeks in his Chamber of Commerce office, had at best only an inkling of Mises&#x0027;s systematic ambition. From book to book, they witnessed the appearance of the successive building blocks of a Misesian system. But when Mises left Vienna in 1934 to move to Geneva, even they could not have had more than a vague notion of how to fit these pieces into a unified whole. Mises was fifty&#x002D;eight years old when <i>National&#x00F6;konomie: Theorie des Handelns und Wirtschaftens<sup><a href="#fn24">24</a></sup></i> appeared. It was Mises&#x0027;s crowning intellectual achievement and the sum of his scholarly life. At long last, this book should have established him as the foremost German&#x002D;language economist and social theorist of his generation.</p>
<p id="pagexii"><a id="ft25"/><a id="ft26"/>Mises&#x0027;s masterwork, however, appeared in the midst of political and personal crisis. After the <i>Anschluss</i> on March 12, 1938, Mises could no longer travel to Austria. His apartment in Vienna had been ransacked by National Socialists and his library and personal papers confiscated.<sup><a href="#fn25">25</a></sup> By June 1940, German troops had virtually encircled Switzerland, and, urged by his wife, Mises decided to leave Geneva and emigrate to the United States. &#x201C;I could no longer bear,&#x201D; he explained in his <i>Erinnerungen</i> written shortly after his arrival in New York City on August 4, 1940, &#x201C;to live in a country that regarded my presence as a political burden and danger to its security.&#x201D;<sup><a href="#fn26">26</a></sup></p>
<p id="ft27">From the outset, the book was cut off almost completely from the German market, and its Swiss publisher would become one of the countless economic casualties of war. Meanwhile, almost all members of the former <i>Mises&#x002D;Kreis</i> had likewise left Austria and emigrated to other countries. In their new, foreign, and uncertain environment, they paid little or no attention to it. Thus, <i>National&#x00F6;konomie</i> remained virtually unread.<sup><a href="#fn27">27</a></sup> What should have been a moment of immense satisfaction and even triumph, a moment which might have brought about a shift away from the growing Keynesian/Walrasian&#x002D;Marshallian consensus, and even inoculated the profession against the positivist onslaught of later decades, became for Mises a moment of tragedy and likely the lowest point in his career.</p>
<p id="ft28">Nine more years would pass until, with the publication of <i>Human Action,</i> Mises would reap some of the rewards that had <a id="pagexiii" />escaped him in 1940.<sup><a href="#fn28">28</a></sup> Yale University Press, headed by Eugene Davidson, had published Mises&#x0027;s <i>Omnipotent Government</i> and <i>Bureaucracy</i> in 1944, on the recommendation of Henry Hazlitt, who was then working for the <i>New York Times</i> as an editorial writer. The success of these works prompted Davidson to send a note to Mises in mid&#x002D;November that would set the process in motion. Mises and Davidson met on Monday, December 4, at the Roosevelt Hotel for lunch, and made plans for a translation of <i>National&#x00F6;konomie,</i> under the working title <i>Treatise in Economics.</i> Davidson found the idea enticing and solicited further opinions on the matter from a variety of economists and public figures.</p>
<p id="ft33"><a id="ft29"/><a id="ft30"/><a id="ft31"/><a id="ft32"/>Hazlitt recommended immediate publication, as did John V. Van Sickle of Vanderbilt University (&#x201C;I hope you will decide on publication&#x201D;<sup><a href="#fn29">29</a></sup>), Ray Bert Westerfield of Yale University (&#x201C;a first&#x002D;rate book&#x201D;<sup><a href="#fn30">30</a></sup>), Hayek (&#x201C;the general standard of the work is of a kind that it will do credit to any University Press&#x201D;<sup><a href="#fn31">31</a></sup>), and Machlup (who, with effusive praise for Mises, encouraged Davidson to ignore all protests against publication; any book &#x201C;out of sympathy with the New Deal in economics&#x201D; would be opposed by the same people<sup><a href="#fn32">32</a></sup>). Haberler, however, wrote, &#x201C;It is a little embarrassing for me to answer your question because Professor Mises is a good friend of mine. Please do keep the contents of this letter strictly confidential. The book you are considering for translation is a very big one. It contains Professor Mises&#x0027;s life work in economics. It is well written and interesting but I must say for my taste it is very extreme, and I am pretty sure it will not be well accepted in academic quarters.&#x2026; May I suggest that you ask Professor Knight of the University of Chicago for his opinion?&#x201D;<sup><a href="#fn33">33</a></sup></p>
<p id="pagexiv"><a id="ft34"/><a id="ft35"/>Yale then consulted Frank H. Knight, who wrote back that Mises is &#x201C;no doubt the last of the great Austrian or Viennese school, since other members of comparable standing turned their scientific along with their political coats, if they did not leave Austria and Germany, and started work on new problems under new auspices.&#x2026; It is my impression&#x2014;not based on adequate knowledge&#x2014;that the author&#x0027;s views on monetary and cycle problems are more important than those on general theory.&#x201D; In an addendum, Knight says he in turn consulted Oskar Lange (one of Mises&#x0027;s leading opponents in the socialist calculation debate) who was &#x201C;surely not more in favor of the project. He thinks von Mises did some pioneering at one time in the monetary field but that is old and long available in English.&#x201D;<sup><a href="#fn34">34</a></sup>In addition, <i>B.H.</i> Beckhart, a former student of Mises&#x0027;s teaching at Columbia University, wrote a terse reply to Davidson: &#x201C;I doubt if Professor Mises&#x0027;s work would have a sufficiently wide sale to justify its translation or publication. Professor Mises&#x0027;s theories are developed rather fully in his works which have already appeared in English.&#x201D;<sup><a href="#fn35">35</a></sup></p>
<p id="ft37"><a id="ft36"/>Despite the protests, bale&#x0027;s Committee <i>on</i> Publications voted <i>to</i> approve the publication March 5, 1945, under the working title <i>National Economy,</i> which would become <i>Human Action</i> just prior to publication.<sup><a href="#fn36">36</a></sup> The publisher received the final manuscript on October 1,1948. By the time the English&#x002D;language version appeared, circumstances were no longer conducive to an early renewal of the Austrian School. Leadership in pure economic theory had passed from Europe to the United States, in part because of the migration of many Central European economists to America. Marshallian price theory in various forms had dominated the textbook literature and undergraduate teaching in the United States since the 1920s, and this dominance was strengthened by the widespread interest in the doctrine of imperfect competition in the journals. In addition, the general equilibrium approach had secured a firm foothold in the United <a id="pagexv" />States economics profession with the publication of Paul Samuelson&#x0027;s <i>Foundations of Economic Analysis</i> in 1947.<sup><a href="#fn37">37</a></sup></p>
<p id="ft42"><a id="ft38"/><a id="ft39"/><a id="ft40"/><a id="ft41"/>In the decades following the appearance of <i>Human Action,</i> it was left to Mises&#x0027;s own students, who studied with him while he served as an unsalaried professor at New York University from 1945&#x2013;1969, to take up the task of developing, propagating, and extending Austrian School theory. Preeminent among these students was Murray N. Rothbard, whose <i>Man, Economy, and State</i> in <i>1962,<sup><a href="#fn38">38</a></sup> America&#x0027;s Great Depression</i> in 1963, and a long series of theoretical and historical studies,<sup><a href="#fn39">39</a></sup> prepared the groundwork for a full&#x002D;scale revival of the Austrian School in the 1970s (precipitated by F.A. Hayek&#x0027;s Nobel Prize in 1974) and the 1980s.<sup><a href="#fn40">40</a></sup> The revival became firmly entrenched and internationalized<sup><a href="#fn41">41</a></sup> in the 1990s with the establishment of scholarly journals dedicated to advancing Misesian economics, and a vast and continuing series of papers, conferences, books, teaching seminars, and professional meetings.<sup><a href="#fn42">42</a></sup></p>
<h2 class="center" style="margin-top:20px;">III.</h2>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:30px;"><span class="dropcap">U</span><i><small>MAN ACTION</small></i> and <i>National&#x00F6;konomie</i> have the same overall structure of seven parts, and the bulk of the English edition consists of material directly translated from the German. However, significant differences exist. <i>Human Action</i> is considerably longer, and contains numerous additions to its predecessor. There are also passages, sections, and chapters in <i>National&#x00F6;konomie</i> which were either omitted, shortened, or significantly altered in <i>Human Action.</i></p>
<p id="pagexvi"><a id="ft43"/><a id="ft44"/><a id="ft45"/><a id="ft46"/>The most important addition in <i>Human Action</i> is Chapter VI on uncertainty. This chapter does not appear in its predecessor, nor is its subject matter discussed elsewhere. Here, Mises further clarifies his earlier epistemological investigations through the introduction of the categorical distinction between apodictic certainty (the realm of praxeology), class probability (the realm of the natural sciences), and case probability (the realm of history). Several commentators have noted the similarity <i>of Mises&#x0027;s</i> distinction between class probability and case probability and that between risk and uncertainty introduced by Knight in <i>Risk, Uncertainty and Profit</i> in 1921.<sup><a href="#fn43">43</a></sup> Yet, it does not appear that Mises was influenced by Knight in this regard. Mises had been long familiar with Knight&#x0027;s work, and had already made reference to <i>Risk, Uncertainty and Profit</i> in <i>National&#x00F6;konomie</i> in conjunction with his discussion of profit and uncertainty.<sup><a href="#fn44">44</a></sup> Rather, it appears more likely that Mises&#x0027;s Chapter VI was stimulated and influenced by his younger brother, Richard von Mises (1883&#x2013;1953). A professor of aerodynamics and applied mathematics at Harvard University, Richard von Mises&#x0027;s most outstanding theoretical achievement was his contribution, from 1919 onward, to the frequency theory of probability.<sup><a href="#fn45">45</a></sup> In principle, Ludwig accepted Richard&#x0027;s frequency interpretation of probability, but Ludwig provided a new definition of randomness, and thus significantly improved on Richard&#x0027;s theory.<sup><a href="#fn46">46</a></sup></p>
<p id="ft48"><a id="ft47"/>Apart from the addition of Chapter VI, all other changes or additions to <i>Human Action</i> from its predecessor can be described as non&#x002D;substantial. Some material is reorganized, the discussion of some subjects is expanded or further applications are provided, and there are some changes in emphasis or perspective. Most reorganization concerns the book&#x0027;s first philosophical parts, i.e., Chapters I and II. Thus, in order to account for an English&#x002D;American audience and <a id="pagexvii" />its different philosophical background and tradition, Mises completely rewrote and rearranged the material presented here.<sup><a href="#fn47">47</a></sup> In addition, <i>Human Action</i> contains a new Chapter HI (&#x201C;Economics and the Revolt against Reason&#x201D;). In <i>National&#x00F6;konomie,</i> the subject matter of Chapter IX of <i>Human Action</i> (&#x201C;The Role of Ideas&#x201D;) is discussed in a much longer chapter of the same title (<i>&#x201C;Die Idee im Handeln</i>&#x201D;).<sup><a href="#fn48">48</a></sup> The expansions, further applications, and changes of emphasis or perspective concern Parts HI through VII.</p>

<p id="ft53" class="noindent" style="margin-top:30px;"><a id="ft49"/><a id="ft50"/><a id="ft51"/><a id="ft52"/><span class="dropcap">T</span>he commercial success of <i>Human Action</i> exceeded both the author&#x0027;s and the publisher&#x0027;s expectations. It was published on September 14, 1949; three weeks later, the press was already planning the second and even a third printing. In a memo, Chester Kerr (who later headed the press when the second edition was issued) spoke of sales of &#x201C;an extraordinary rate for a $10 volume of solid reading.&#x201D; In January 1950, it became a Book&#x002D;of&#x002D;the&#x002D;Month Club alternate selection. Reviews, as one might expect, were highly polarized, with the popular press treating it as the brilliant work of a genius, while academic economists (Seymour E. Harris<sup><a href="#fn49">49</a></sup> and John K. Galbraith<sup><a href="#fn50">50</a></sup>) regarded it as shockingly archaic and insufficiently pious towards the profession. John Hicks alternately praised (&#x201C;a powerful book&#x201C;) and mocked the book (&#x201C;Mises sets up Capitalism as a god, which it is sinful to touch&#x201C;),<sup><a href="#fn51">51</a></sup> while Ludwig Lachmann gave Mises one of his few enthusiastic academic endorsements in the pages of <i>Economica.<sup><a href="#fn52">52</a></sup></i> A debate between Mises&#x0027;s student and prime defender Murray Rothbard and detractor George J. Schuller took place in the pages of <i>the American Economic</i> <a id="pagexix" /><i>Review.<sup><a href="#fn53">53</a></sup></i> Regardless of the mixed reception, and contrary to the widespread opinion that Mises would surely be the last member of the Austrian School, <i>Human Action</i> served as the essential foundation for the huge and growing free&#x002D;market political movement and an academic movement of Austrian School economists, for which it continues to serve as the primary text today.</p>
<p>The first edition of <i>Human Action</i> was continuously in print for fourteen years. In February 1961, Mises initiated the second revised edition <i>of Human Action</i> in a letter to Ivan Bierly of the Volker Fund, a foundation that had supported Mises&#x0027;s teaching and writing. In March, Mises wrote the publisher, &#x201C;It seems to me that now after twelve years it is time to publish a new edition, revised in some points and slightly enlarged.&#x201D; He informed Yale that he could have the changes by the end of the year. Yale Press received the news with enthusiasm and waited for Mises&#x0027;s changes.</p>
<p id="ft55"><a id="ft54"/>What followed was another trial in Mises&#x0027;s life. The second edition went into production far later than anticipated, which left the publisher without copies of <i>Human Action</i> for fifteen months. Mises was never given galley proofs to examine before publication. When the second edition finally appeared in May 1963, it was riddled with typographical errors. There were missing paragraphs and lines, duplicated lines, and even a duplicated page. There were no running heads on the pages and the printing was variously light and dark. Despite protests, the publisher refused to accept full responsibility, which led Mises to secure the services of an attorney. In die <i>de facto</i> settlement (Mises never acceded to it entirely), Yale distributed errata sheets and agreed to prepare a corrected third edition when the second edition sold out. The matter was finally settled when Henry Regnery worked to secure the rights for his publishing company in early 1966. He reset the book and published the third edition later that year (at which time Mises was eighty&#x002D;five years old).<sup><a href="#fn54">54</a>, <a href="#fn55">55</a></sup></p>
<p id="pagexx">Mises left no essay or speech explaining the changes (some of them substantial) made to later editions of <i>Human Action.</i> Original drafts of manuscripts delivered to the publisher are not available. Neither are personal notes available, from Mises or the publisher, or information on the precise timing of the changes. Some changes to later editions were suggested by Mises&#x0027;s friend Percy L. Greaves, Jr., in a memo dated October 12,1961. For instance, Greaves suggested that Mises alter the content of paragraph three on page 187, dealing with German aggressiveness, to apply to Russia. The paragraph was eliminated entirely. Greaves also suggested that the section on International Monetary Cooperation beginning on page 473 &#x201C;be brought up to date.&#x201D; Four paragraphs were added to the end of the original (unchanged) section. Referring to immigration, Mises writes on pages 820&#x2013;821 : &#x201C;Neither does it mean that there can be any question of appeasing aggressors by removing migration barriers. As conditions are today, the Americas and Australia in admitting German, Italian, and Japanese immigrants merely open their doors to the vanguards of hostile armies.&#x201D; Greaves suggested amending this passage, but no change was made in the second edition. For the third edition, the passage is eliminated altogether and replaced with an additional paragraph calling for a philosophy of mutual cooperation to replace the view that there are &#x201C;irreconcilable antagonisms&#x201D; between groups in society.</p>
<p id="ft57"><a id="ft56"/>Other notable changes were made to later editions, some of which cannot be considered improvements. Pages 796&#x2013;799 of the first edition include some insightful remarks about the workings of German exchange controls and international barter agreements in the 1930s. These comments, cited and built upon in a later historical study of the New Deal by Rothbard,<sup><a href="#fn56">56</a></sup> are entirely eliminated from subsequent editions. The final two paragraphs on page 563, in which Mises sheds light on the relationship between public opinion and an inflationary monetary policy, are also eliminated. As a smaller matter, for later editions, the section on imperfect competition was changed from the 1949 edition, and not with clarifying results. For <a id="pagexxi" />instance, the 1949 edition includes this sentence: &#x201C;The confusion which led to the idea of imperfect or monopolistic competition stems from a misinterpretation of the term <i>control of supply&#x201D;</i> (p. 357). Later editions change the sentence to introduce ambiguity: &#x201C;Considerable confusion stems from a misinterpretation of the term <i>control of supply.</i> &#x201C;<sup><a href="#fn57">57</a></sup></p>
<p id="ft58">On monopoly theory, the first edition contains a crucial paragraph that was eliminated in subsequent editions, a passage that elucidates how far Mises&#x0027;s understanding of the monopoly price was from the mainstream neoclassical view. &#x201C;Monopoly prices,&#x201D; he writes in this and later editions, &#x201C;are the outcome of a deliberate design tending toward a restriction of trade&#x201D; (p. 356). In the original edition Mises added an additional paragraph explaining what is meant by the word &#x201C;deliberate.&#x201D; It is only the economist who can contrast the competitive price with the monopoly price; the businessman, &#x201C;like every other seller,&#x201D; only wants to realize the highest price attainable. With this passage, we gain a deeper understanding of Mises&#x0027;s own theory, which is closer to the Rothbardian view that in the actual operation of the free market, there is no meaningful way to distinguish between a monopoly and a competitive price. Indeed, neither Mises nor Rothbard regarded their respective positions on monopoly as incompatible.<sup><a href="#fn58">58</a></sup></p>
<p id="ft59">One particular change has caused considerable confusion. In section XV.6<i>,</i> &#x201C;Freedom,&#x201D; the original edition focuses on die necessity of curbing government power, and concludes that government is &#x201C;by necessity the opposite of liberty&#x201D; and is a &#x201C;guarantor of liberty and is compatible with liberty only if its range is adequately restricted to the preservation of economic freedom&#x201D; (p. 283).<sup><a href="#fn59">59</a></sup> <a id="pagexxii" />Revised editions preserve that passage with only minor alterations, but add seven wholly new paragraphs preceding it. These new paragraphs in the revised editions introduce a different focus on the necessary and specific powers of government, which appear rather expansive by Misesian standards: &#x201C;The maintenance of a government apparatus of courts, police officers, prison, and of armed forces requires considerable expenditure. To levy taxes for these purposes is fully compatible with the freedom the individual enjoys in a free market economy&#x201D; (third ed., p. 282).</p>
<p>Also, these later editions substantially alter the definition of freedom itself. In the original, Mises states: &#x201C;A man is free as far as he can live and get on without being at the mercy of arbitrary decisions on the part of other people&#x201D; (p. 279). Mises does not define &#x201C;arbitrary,&#x201D; but he appears to have in mind actions that infringe on someone&#x0027;s person or property without his agreement. Revised editions, in contrast, state: &#x201C;we may define freedom as that state of affairs in which the individual&#x0027;s decision to choose is not constrained by governmental violence beyond the margin which the praxeological law restricts it anyway&#x201D; (third ed., p. 282). The phrase &#x201C;praxeological law&#x201D; (meaning the law of cause and effect in human affairs) works here as qualifier; it is so expansively applied that any government activity, however arbitrary, that is said to preserve or achieve &#x201C;freedom&#x201D; might be deemed permissible. The original definition, more specific and stringent, rules out arbitrary interventions altogether.</p>
<p id="ft62"><a id="ft60"/><a id="ft61"/>Thus, these added passages in later editions go even further to permit conscription, and it is here we find a direct inconsistency with Mises&#x0027;s prior writings. In particular, the passage is at odds with Mises&#x0027;s defense of secession, which he elevated to the rank of a core principle of the liberal program, as explained in <i>Nation, State, and Economy</i> in 1919<sup><a href="#fn60">60</a></sup> and even more emphatically in <i>Liberalism</i> in 192 7.<sup><a href="#fn61">61</a></sup> If every person is entitled to secede from the state then the <a id="pagexxiii" />state becomes a kind of voluntary organization from which exit is always allowed; accordingly, any form of conscription would have to be considered illegitimate and impermissible. Even more strikingly, however, the passage stands in contradiction to the discussion, and rejection, in <i>National&#x00F6;konomie</i> of conscription as a species of interventionism which, according to its own internal &#x201C;logic,&#x201D; leads inevitably to socialism and total war. &#x201C;Military conscription,&#x201D; Mises wrote, &#x201C;leads to compulsory public service of everyone capable of work. The supreme commander controls the entire people,&#x2026; the mobilization has become total; people and state have become part of the army; war socialism has replaced the market economy.&#x201D;<sup><a href="#fn62">62</a></sup></p>

<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:30px;"><span class="dropcap">H</span><i><small>UMAN ACTION,</small></i> building on and expanding its German predecessor, transformed Austrian economics, as it is understood today, into a predominantly American phenomenon with a distinctly Misesian imprint, and made possible the continuation of the Austrian School after the mid&#x002D;twentieth century. Thus the first edition assumes an importance that extends beyond the mere historical. It reveals the issues and concerns that Mises considered primary when releasing, at die height of his intellectual powers, the most complete and integrated statement of his career. In particular, making the unchanged first edition available again retrieves important passages that were later eliminated, and clarifies questions raised by unnecessary, and, in some cases, unfortunate additions and revisions made to later editions.</p>
<p>That the original edition represents the fullest synthesis of Mises&#x0027;s thought on method, theory, and policy, and is the book that sustained the Austrian tradition and the integrity of economic science after the socialist, Keynesian, Walrasian, Marshallian, and positivist conquests of economic thought, is reason enough to reissue die original on its fiftieth anniversary, making it widely available for the first time in nearly four decades. A high place must be reserved in the history of economic thought, indeed, in die history of ideas, for Mises&#x0027;s masterwork. Even today, <i>Human Action</i> points the way to a brighter future for the science of economics and the practice of human liberty.</p>

<p id="fn36" class="notes"><a href="#ft36">36</a>. Mises suggested the following as possible tides: (1) <i>Economics: A Treatise on Human Action,</i> (2) <i>Man and Reality: A Treatise on Human Action,</i> (3) <i>Means and Ends: A Treatise on Economics,</i> (4) <i>Man in the Pursuit of a Better Life: A Treatise on Economics,</i> and (5) <i>Human Action: A Treatise on Economics. Next</i> to this final suggestion, Davidson wrote &#x201C;I like this&#x201D; but worried that it &#x201C;doesn&#x0027;t make the subject immediately clear.&#x201D;</p>

<p id="fn40" class="notes"><a href="#ft40">40</a>. Rothbard&#x0027;s efforts culminated in a monumental two&#x002D;volume history of economic thought, <i>Economic Thought Before Adam Smith,</i> vol. 1 and <i>Classical Economics,</i> vol. 2 (Brookfield, Vt.: Edward Elgar, 1995).</p>

<p id="fn47" class="notes"><a href="#ft47">47</a>. Thus, for instance, <i>National&#x00F6;konomie</i> contains in its first two chapters several references to Immanuel Kant and Heinrich Rickert, as well as references to Franz Brentano, Wilhelm Windelband, Ernst Mach, Fritz Mauthner, and Hans Rothacker which were omitted in <i>Human Action.</i></p>
<p id="fn48" class="notes"><a href="#ft48">48</a>. Similarly, <i>National&#x00F6;konomie&#x0027;s</i> chapter <i>Die Idee im Handeln</i> contains references to Hendrik de Man, Hans Delbr&#x00FC;ck, Carl Menger, Hans Keiseren, Ludwig Gumplowicz, Gustav Ratzenhofer, Joseph&#x002D;Arthur Gobineau, and Houston Chamberlain not to be found in the corresponding Chapters III and IX <i>of Human Action.</i></p>

<p id="fn54" class="notes"><a href="#ft54">54</a>. The mystery of who precisely was responsible for mangling the treatise has never been solved. Margit von Alises, discussing the matter in her memoirs, offers this: &#x201C;the villain in a Perry Mason story is easy to detect. It is always the one whom you suspect least and whom the author treats with a certain indulgent negligence.&#x201D; <i>My Years with Ludwig von Mises</i> (Cedar Falls, Iowa: Center for Futures Education, [1976] 1984), p. 111.</p>
<p id="fn55" class="notes"><a href="#ft55">55</a>. The &#x201C;fourth revised edition&#x201D; (Irvington&#x002D;on&#x002D;Hudson, N.Y.: Foundation for Economic Education, 1996) is the third edition with an expanded index.</p>

<p id="fn57" class="notes"><a href="#ft57">57</a>. Additions in later editions not discussed here include XVI.6, pars. 5&#x2013;6 and XXVII.6 &#x201C;Corruption.&#x201D; As further evidence of a general thinning of language that takes place in later editions, consider that on page 566, in a discussion of the manner in which busts follow artificial booms, the last sentence of the continued paragraph (&#x201C;They are inevitable&#x201C;) was removed.</p>
<p id="fn58" class="notes"><a href="#ft58">58</a>. Mises conveyed this view in private correspondence, and during his New York seminar, where he was frequently asked about possible differences with Rothbard following the release of <i>Man, Economy, and State</i> (Bettina Bien Greaves&#x0027;s notes, privately held, 1962&#x2013;1965).</p>
<p id="fn59" class="notes"><a href="#ft59">59</a>. This is consistent with Mises&#x0027;s <i>Liberalism:</i> &#x201C;Human society cannot do without the apparatus of the state, but the whole of mankind&#x0027;s progress has had to be achieved against the resistance and opposition of the state and its power of coercion. No wonder that all who have had something new to offer humanity have had nothing good to say of the state or its laws!&#x201D; (San Francisco: Cobden Press, [1927] 1985), p. 58.</p>

<p id="fn61" class="notes"><a href="#ft61">61</a>. For Mises, the only possible objections to unlimited secession were practical or technical, not principled concerns. <i>Liberalism,</i> pp. 109&#x2013;110.</p>
