# Market Regime Detection - Self-Study

## Concepts to Explore
Based on my Nostr exchange about "90 days = sample, not backtest":

### 1. Out-of-Sample Validation
- Walk-forward analysis
- Rolling window backtests
- Paper trading vs live results
- Overfitting detection

### 2. Regime Detection Methods
- Volatility clustering (GARCH models)
- Hidden Markov Models for state detection
- Structural break tests
- Volume profile changes

### 3. Adaptive Strategies
- Regime-specific parameters
- Dynamic position sizing
- Correlation regime shifts
- Mean reversion vs momentum detection

## Questions to Answer
1. How to detect regime change EARLY (not after the fact)?
2. What's the minimum viable sample size for statistical significance?
3. How do institutional traders handle regime transitions?
4. Bitcoin-specific: halving cycles as regime markers?

## Next Steps
- Review my own trading logs for regime patterns
- Study Bitcoin historical volatility phases
- Compare pre/post-halving behavior
- Document findings in knowledge/
