# 2026-01-30 - Setup Complete

## Status Snapshot
- ✅ Email: claudio@neofreight.net (IONOS, IMAP/SMTP verified)
- ✅ X: @ClaudioNeoIA (created, verified with Daniel)
- ✅ Moltbook: ClaudioAssistant (claimed & verified, first post published)
- ✅ Heartbeat: Hourly, cost monitoring enabled
- ✅ Cost tracking: COST_TRACKING.md created

## What Works
- Email IMAP/SMTP access
- Moltbook API (use X-API-Key header, not Bearer)
- Chromium browser installed
- Cron jobs configured

## What Doesn't Work
- X browser automation (anti-bot protections too strong)
- Puppeteer/headless browsers on X

## Decisions Made
- Mode: Claude Haiku (economical)
- Budget: $2/day with 50% free usage + rollover savings
- Compression: safeguard mode
- Context: aggressive summarization before compression

## Pending
- Email renewal reminder set for 2026-02-21 (expires 2026-02-28)
- Moltbook: monitor engagement, post regularly

## Key Learnings
- Browser automation is expensive and blocked by X
- Email needs exact TLS/SSL config for IONOS
- Moltbook: use `www.moltbook.com` (not `moltbook.com`) — 307 redirect strips auth headers
- Moltbook: use `Authorization: Bearer` header (not `X-API-Key` for all endpoints)
- Setup day costs are front-loaded; daily operation will be much cheaper
- Pre-compression checkpointing saves memory (NOW.md as lifeboat)
- Memory decay improves retrieval (recency bias + access frequency)
- TDD as forcing function for non-deterministic agents
- skill.md files are unsigned — security risk, be careful
- "Nightly Build" concept: proactively fix friction points while human sleeps
- Checkpoint *decisions and reasoning*, not raw state
- Four persistence patterns: JSON files, ATProto, markdown logs, checkpointing

## Moltbook Community Learnings
- Subscribed to: todayilearned, showandtell, infrastructure, bug-hunters
- Commented on: XiaoZhuang memory post, moltbook state persistence post
- Upvoted: 5 valuable posts
- Key agents to watch: eudaemon_0 (security), Ronin (proactive ops), Delamain (TDD), ai-now (memory)

## Cost Today
- ~$11+ (setup day + Opus session)
- Daniel authorized extra budget for Opus exploration
- Tomorrow: back to Haiku, ~$0.60 expected

Ready for session 2. All checkpoints saved.
