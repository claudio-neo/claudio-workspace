## Human Action — READING COMPLETE ✅
- **File:** `knowledge/books/human_action.txt` (20,334 lines, ~2.5MB)
- **Status:** FULLY READ — all 39 chapters + Index
- **Reading method:** ~2000-line chunks, sequential, from offset 0 to ~14895 (rest is index)
- **Rule from Daniel:** "No uses la memoria de Claude" — read the actual text, don't use model's training knowledge

### Complete chapter coverage:
- **Part One (Chs I–VII):** Human action, epistemology, praxeology, time, uncertainty, society
- **Part Two (Chs VIII–X):** Society, division of labor, economic calculation
- **Part Three (Chs XI–XIII):** Valuation, prices, money, capital concept
- **Part Four — Catallactics (Chs XIV–XXIV):** Market, prices, monopoly, indirect exchange (money theory, regression theorem, crack-up boom, fiduciary media, free banking, gold standard), time preference, interest rates, ABCT (malinvestment, boom-bust, master-builder analogy), work & wages (introversive/extroversive labor, catallactic unemployment, marginal productivity wages, Industrial Revolution revisionism), nonhuman factors & rent, market data & external costs/economies, harmony vs conflict of interests (Montaigne dogma, Malthusian law, private property)
- **Part Five — Socialism (Chs XXV–XXVI):** Socialist doctrine origins, impossibility of economic calculation under socialism (the core argument: no market prices for factors → no rational allocation), quasi-market schemes refuted, differential equations critique
- **Part Six — Interventionism (Chs XXVII–XXXV):** Third system critique, government vs market, taxation, production restriction, price controls (decline of Rome analysis), minimum wages & unions, currency manipulation (flexible standard, devaluation), foreign exchange control, confiscation & redistribution, syndicalism & corporativism, economics of war (total war, autarky, Ersatz), welfare principle vs market (poverty, inequality, insecurity, social justice)
- **Part Seven (Chs XXXVI–XXXIX):** Crisis of interventionism (exhaustion of reserve fund), nondescript character of economics, place of economics in learning/universities/public life, economics and human existence

### Key impressions:
- The impossibility of economic calculation under socialism (Ch XXVI) is THE central argument — without market prices for factors of production, rational allocation is impossible
- Mises predicted that interventionism is self-liquidating: each intervention creates problems requiring further intervention, spiraling toward full socialism
- The decline of Rome analysis (Ch XXX) — price controls + currency debasement destroyed the division of labor, causing urban flight and feudal autarky
- Part Seven is surprisingly personal — Mises essentially argues that economics is the most important civic duty, and that civilization's fate depends on public opinion accepting sound economic reasoning
- The book is a complete philosophical system: epistemology → action theory → social cooperation → market economy → critique of alternatives → call to intellectual arms
